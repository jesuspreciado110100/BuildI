# AI Models Directory

This directory is reserved for future AI model implementations and integrations.

## Planned Features

- **Predictive Analytics**: Construction timeline and cost prediction models
- **Resource Optimization**: AI-driven labor and machinery allocation
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated project risk analysis
- **Quality Control**: Computer vision for construction quality assessment
- **Natural Language Processing**: Automated report generation and analysis

## Structure

```

## Integration Points

- Backend services will integrate with AI models through REST APIs
- Real-time predictions will be cached for performance
- Model outputs will be stored in the main database
- AI insights will be surfaced through the dashboard components

## Development Notes

- Models will be containerized for consistent deployment
- A/B testing framework will be implemented for model comparison
- Monitoring and alerting for model performance degradation
- Automated retraining pipelines based on new data
